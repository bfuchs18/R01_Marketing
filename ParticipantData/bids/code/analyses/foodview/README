Code development:
Scripts are developed locally on Bari's computer, where they are committed and pushed to GitHub.
Scripts are then synced to Roar Collab for testing and running on the HPC.
Changes are made locally and re-synced to Roar Collab. 

To sync files from local to Roar Collab:

>> cd /Users/baf44/projects/Keller_Marketing/ParticipantData/bids/code/analyses/
>> rsync -av --update foodview baf44@submit.hpc.psu.edu:/storage/group/klk37/default/R01_Marketing/bids/code/analyses/
