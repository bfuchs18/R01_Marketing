# Study Design

Study REACH involves a total of 5 visits for parent-child dyads (Figure 1). The first 4 visits occur ~1 week apart; these are referred to as baseline or session 1 ('ses-1') visits; the 5th visit occurs ~1 year after baseline; this visit is referred to as follow-up or session 2 ('ses-2').

The 4 baseline visits include: Child Visit Protocol 1, Child Visit Protocol 2, Child Visit Protocol 3, and Child Visit Protocol 4. Child Visit Protocol 1 always occurred on the first study visit, while Child Visit Protocols 2-4 could vary in order due to MRI availability. The follow-up visit includes Child Visit Protocol 5. 

Parents completed sets of questionnaires for each of the 5 visits.

## Baseline visits (session 1)
### Child Visit Protocol 1 (visit 1)

The first visit takes place in Noll Lab. During the visit, the parent and child complete consent and assent, respectively. Child and parent [height and weight](#height-and-weight) are measured twice by a researcher and children complete a [Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA)](#dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry-dxa) scan. 
Children then complete the [test meal](#test-meal) protocol with the neutral advertisment condition. This test meal is recorded to code [meal microstructure](#). The children also rate their fullness using [Freddy Fullness](#) and [liking](#) and [wanting](#) of foods. Children complete the [NIH toolbox](#nih-toolbox) and [Relative Reinforceing Value task](#relative-reinforcing-value-task-rrv) and watch a [mock fMRI video](#mock-scan-protocol). Both parents and children also complete questionnaires on REDCap.

### Child Visit Protocol 2

The second visit takes place in Chandlee Laboratory. Upon arrival, the children rate their [fullness](#fullness) to ensure they are in a neutral state prior to completing the (functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm)[#]. If they rate their fullness below 25%, they are given a snack and then rate their fullness again. This is repeated one more time if fullness remains below 25% (i.e., maximum of 2 snacks administered). Then, children complete a practice run and 2 behavioral runs of the [Stop Signal Task)](#functional---stop-signal-task-plate-sorting-game) before heading to SLEIC's MRI suite. In the MRI suite, children complete a [mock fMRI scan](#mock-scan-protocol) and then rate their [fullness](#fullness) and [state anxiety](#) before entering the MRI for the [fMRI Protocol](#functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging). After the scan, children rate [state anxiety](#) again and are provided a snack (small pizza, bag of chips, apple juice; intake not measured).

## Anthropometrics

### Height and Weight
Height (m) and weight (kg) of the child and enrolled parent (parent1) are measured twice by a trained research at Noll Laboratory. The dual measurements are averaged to derive average height and weight for child and parent. Average measurements are used to calculate:
* Parent1 BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
* Child BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)
* Child BMI percentile (CDC reference for age and sex)
* Child BMI z-score (CDC reference for age and sex)

Height and weight of the biological parent that does not attend the visit (parent2) are reported by parent1 in the [Parent Household Demographics Questionnaire](#parent-household-demographics-questionnaire). Parent1-reported height and weight of parent2 are used to calculated:
* Parent2 BMI

The sexes of parent1 and parent2 are used to generate the variables:
* Maternal BMI
* Paternal BMI
* Maternal BMI method (measured, report)
* Paternal BMI method (measured, report)

### Structural scan

### Functional scans - Food View Task

The Food View Task was developed to characterize the effects of food (vs. toy) commercials on children’s neural processing of food-cues. During the task, children were presented with food images after viewing toy and food commercials. 


<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Task Design

The Food View Task was administered using [Matlab2018b and Psychtoolbox3]. 

The Food View Task included 4 functional MRI runs (~3.7 min each). Each run included 4 commercial blocks (2 food, 2 toy) and 4 food image blocks (2 high-ED, 2 low-ED). Commercial and food image blocks were presented in alternating order, always starting with a commercial block. Commercial blocks contained 2 commercials (~30 seconds total) and food image blocks contained 5 images (1.5 seconds each with 0.5s fixation following each image). Between blocks, a fixation cross was presented on the screen for 6-8 seconds (jittered). Within a run, toy and food commercial blocks were presented in alternating order. For each subject, 2 runs started with toy commercials and 2 started with food commericals; which runs these were varied by subject (counterbalanced?).


Within each run, 2 food image blocks contained high-ED foods and 2 contained low-ED foods. Therefore a 2 (after toy commercial, after food commercial) x 2 (high-ED foods, low-ED foods) design could be used to explore the effects of commercials on children’s neural processing of food-cues by energy density.

### Functional Scans - Stop Signal Task ("Plate Sorting Game")

The stop-signal task (SST) assesses inhibitory control by measuring the latency of response inhibition. To assess the effects of food (vs. toy) commercials on inhibitory control, children performed rounds of the SST after viewing toy and food commercials. 

The SST was adapted from the implementation in (Verbruggen, Logan, & Stevens, 2008). For a thorough discussion of the theoretical basis for the race-horse model of response inhibition see (Verbruggen & Logan, 2009). The basic premise is that participants will first activate a go-response to a stimuli. After seeing the stop stimuli, they will activate a nogo-response. If they are successful in inhibiting the go-response, the nogo-response was faster. If they fail to inhibit the go-response, the nogo-response was too slow. In this task, inhibition can be measured by manipulating the delay of the stop signal using a step-like function to hold successful stopping at a .5 probability. 


![Racehorse_Model](./images/sst_racehorse_model.png)

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Task Design

The SST was administered using [Matlab2018b and Psychtoolbox3]. 

SST runs were administered under practice, behavioral, and fmri contexts. Practices runs contained an explanation of the task followed by 1 SST block. Behavioral and fMRI runs contained commerical and SST blocks presented in alternating order, always starting with a commercial block.

![MRI Visit protocol](./images/Reach_v2.png)

#### Child instructions
Children were asked to sort the plates according to which side of the plate the napkin was on and to press the left or right arrow keys when the napkin appeared on the left or right side of the plate, respectively. They were encouraged to respond as quickly as possible. Children were instructed not to respond when the dome (i.e., stop signal) appeared.

#### SST Blocks
Each SST block included 36 event trials (10 stop trials and 26 go trials). 

During each trial, a plate of food was presented with a triangle-folded napkin on either the left or right side of the plate (go stimulus; see Figure 1). On stop trials, the plate would get covered with a warmer dome (i.e., stop-signal; see Figure 1). The warmer dome (i.e., stop-signal) was presented after a variable stop-signal delay (SSD) determined by a step-wise adaptive procedure which increased the SSD 50ms after each successful stop trial and reduced the SSD by 50 ms after each unsuccessful stop trial with the first SSD on all runs = 250 ms. This adaptive procedure maintained ~0.50 probability of successful response inhibition. The task parameters were based on specifications articulated by Verbruggen and colleagues (2019) for best practices in measuring stop-signal reaction time according to the theoretical racehorse model.

Go trials were defined as the go stimulus plus a post-go fixation, which in total were 1000ms in duration. Stop trials were defined as the go stimulus plus the stop signal, which in total were 1000ms in duration. In practice runs, trials were followed by immediate feedback (750ms) and 500ms fixation. During fMRI runs, go and stop trials were followed by a variables fixation (1s - 5s).

##### Practice Runs

Children completed 2 separate practice runs: 1 before the behavioral runs and 1 before the fMRI in the mock scanner. 

Each practice run included an explanation of the task followed by 1 SST block. During the SST block, immediate feedback was presented for 750ms after each trial: "correct": presented for correct go or stop response; "incorrect": presented for incorrect go response (i.e., left vs. right response); "do not respond": presented for failed stop trial; "faster": presented if no response made on go trial (omission). 


##### Beh and Task Runs 

Each Beh and fMRI run included 2 commerical and 2 SST blocks presented in alternating order, always starting with a commercial block. Children completed 2 Beh runs and 6 fMRI runs.
Each commerical block contained 1 commerical (~15 seconds). The interblock fixation in Beh runs was 2 seconds, while it was 10 seconds in fMRI runs.


Immediate feedback was presented during behavioral blocks to prevent children from slowing throughout the task: the message ‘Faster’ was presented for 500ms after SST trials when children responded slower than 1.5 standard deviations below their mean reaction time in practice. Between behavioral runs, children were given the opportunity to take a break and were shown their average response time (e.g., ‘How Fast Were You?’), given encouragement for how quickly the were responding (e.g., ‘Wow, that is faster than a second’), and were reminded not to press the arrow keys if the dome covered the plate.  

No immediate feedback was presented furing fMRI runs. Between fMRI runs, children were reminded not to press the arrow keys if the dome covered the plate (via text on screen or verbal reminder if many mistakes) and to stay as still as possible.

## Parent-Reported Questionnaires

All parent questionnaires were administered using REDCap.

### Visit 1 Demographics

The Visit 1 Demographics form assesses child demographics and items related to birth and infancy (e.g., birth weight, infant feeding practices). This questionnaire was developed within the Keller Lab for Study REACH.

Items from this questionnaire are reported in 2 databases in bids/phenotype: 
  * Child demographic variables (race, ethnicity) are reported in:
    * demographics.tsv and demographics.json
  * Items related to birth and infancy are reported in:
    * infancy.tsv and infancy.json

### Parent Household Demographics Questionnaire

The Parent Household Demographics Questionnaire assesses parent demographics and the household environment. This questionnaire was developed within the Keller Lab for Study REACH.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Database and meta-data in bids/phenotype: 
  * household.tsv and household.json

Items from this questionnaire that are commonly reported in papers or used as covariates (i.e., maternal education, family income) have also been included in demographics.tsv and demographics.json.

### Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is a 10-item screening instrument for hazardous and/or harmful alcohol consumption. A score of 8 or more indicates a strong likelihood of harmful alcohol consumption.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scale
Most questions used the stated scale with alternative responses of equal weight in parentheses:

0) Never (1-2 drinks; No)
1) Less than Monthly (Monthly or Less; 3 or 4 drinks)
2) Monthly (2-4 Times a Month; 5 or 6 drinks; Yes, but not in the last year)
3) Weekly (2-3 Times a Week; 7 to 9 drinks)
4) Daily or Almost Daily (4 or More Times a Week; 10 or more drinks; Yes, during the last year)

Note: 2 items (9 and 10) use the scale 0, 2, 4 (i.e., 1 and 3 are not included).

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Outcome Measures:
* Total Score
* Category (Not Harmful Consumtion, Likely Harmful Consumption)

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scoring
The sum of responses is computed if there are no missing responses. Scores >= 8 are categorized as "Likely Harmful Consumption" while scores <8 are categorized as "Not Harmful Consumtion". Scoring is implemented using [dataprepr](#dataprepr).

### Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS)

The BIS/BAS scale assesses 2 motivational systems proposed to underlie behavior and affect: a behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and a behavioral activation system (BAS). The scale contains 20 scored items and 4 filler items. Parents completed a parent-report version using a 4-point likert scale to assess child BIS/BAS sensitivity.


<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Raw data scale:

0) Very True for Me
1) Somewhat True for Me
2) Somewhat False for Me
3) Very False for Me

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subscales / Outcome measures:
| Subscale | Items* |
| -------- | ------- | 
| Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) | 16*, 24*, 8*, 13*, 2, 19*, 22|
| BAS Funseeking | 10*, 20*, 5*, 15*|
| BAS Drive | 9*, 3*, 12*, 21* |
| BAS Reward Responsiveness | 7*, 4*, 18*, 23*, 14*|
| Behavioral Activation System (BAS) | Funseeking, Drive, and Reward Responsiveness items|
* *reverse-scored item

Note, in the literature, different versions of the BIS/BAS use different and opposing scoring scales (e.g., higher scores indicate disagreement vs agreement). The direction of the scale used here is consistent in direction with Carver et al., and Blair et al., but not Muris et al. [Documentation from the University of Washington](https://depts.washington.edu/uwcssc/sites/default/files//hw00/d40/uwcssc/sites/default/files/BIS-BAS.pdf) suggests this version of the scale should be scored by reverse-scoring all items except 2 and 22, which is seeminly different that reported by Carver, but makes more sense intuitively (e.g., such that higher BIS scores indicate higher behavioral inhibition sensitivity).

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scoring:
Responses are scaled to base 1 (i.e., 1-4) and reverse scoring is implemented for reverse-scored items. The mean of scaled responses is computed for each subscale if there are no missing responses. Scoring is implemented using [dataprepr](#dataprepr).

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scoring
Responses are scaled to base 1 (i.e., 1-3). Raw scores are calculated as following:
* Clinical scales, indexes and global executive composite: the sum of responses for a subscale is computed if all responses were completed
* Inconsistency: the sum of absolute differences between the set A and set B subscale items
* Negativity: the number of subscale items that equal 3
* Infrequency: the number of subscale items > 1

Age and sex are used to determine subscale T-scores and percentiles from raw scores. Scoring is implemented using [dataprepr](#dataprepr).

### Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS)

description...

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Raw data scales: 
The scale differed depending on the item:

* Event scale (Items asking if event occured):
  0) No 
  1) Yes
  -99) I don't know or Don't want to answer 

* Frequency scale (Items asking about frequency of event; administered only if responder indicated event occured):
  0) Rarely
  1) Sometimes
  2) Often

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Outcome Measures:

| Outcome measure | Items | 
| -------- | ------- | 
| Total Score | Frequency items 1-9 |
| Category Score | Frequeny items 1-9 |
| Anxiety domain indicator | Event item 1 |
| Insufficient Quality domain indicator | Event item 2, 3, 4 |
| Insufficient food intake and physical consequences domain indicator | Event item 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 |

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scoring: 
The value of unadminiseted Frequency items (i.e., corresponding event did not occur) are set to 0 (Rarely). The sum of the responses to Frequency items is computed if there are no missing responses (total score). Category score is determined based on responses to indiviudal Frequency items.  Indicator values are set to 1 if any Event item occured (value = 1) for a given domain. Scoring is implemented using [dataprepr](#dataprepr).

### Lifestyle Behavior Checklist (LBC)

The LBC is a questionnaire to assess child weight-related behaviour problems and parents' confidence in managing these behaviours. It contains 2 scales: (1) a Problem Scale which assesses the extent to which certain behaviors have been a problem and (2) a Confidence Scale which assesses how confident the responder is in dealing with a problem.

The original scale included 26 concerns parents might have about children's behavior and 2 optional open-ended items; one of conerns ("Item 11. Behaves disruptively at mealtime") and the 2 optional items did not differ between groups with HW and OB, so the authors suggested these items could be omitted from the questionnaire. 

Compared to the revised 24-item version from which a 4-factor subscale solution was derived, the 25-item version excludes item 20. REACH used the 25-item version. 

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scale: 
Scales differ for Problem Scale and Confidence Scale items: 

Problem Scale items use an integer scale from 0-6 with the anchors:
* 0 = Not much at all
* 3 = Somewhat
* 6 = Very much

Confidence Scale items use an integer scale from 0-9 with the anchors:
* 0 = Certain I cannot do it
* 9 = Certain I can do it

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Subscales/outcome measures:
| Subscale | Items | 
| -------- | ------- | 
| Food-related misbehavior | 3-6, 8, 10, 11|
| Overeating | 1, 2, 9, 12-15 |
| Emotion related to being overweight | 21-25 |
| Physical activity | 7, 16-19|
| Total Problem score | |
| Total Confidence score | |

Note: The 4-factor subscales was developed using a 24-item questionnaire, which excluded item 20 (West et al. 2010).

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Scoring
Only Problem Scale items are used in scoring. Response are scaled to base 1 (i.e., 1-7). The mean of the scaled responses is computed for each subscale if there are no missing responses. Scoring is implemented using [dataprepr](#dataprepr).
